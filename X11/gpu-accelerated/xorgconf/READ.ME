1. File 20-nvidia.conf was created in order to solve the problem that Xorg is trying to initialize the second Nvidia card although this card was never passhthrough. This causes Xorg to simply fail to initiazlize the GPU and no gpu acceleration is possible. This files explicitely tells Xorg that there
is only one vide card! At the end no errors are found duing Xorg start and the X Server starts without a problem.

2. The reason for the black screen with NoMachine was a bug in the very beautiful lightdm aether greeter. When you change lightdm to use its basic lightdm-gtk-greeter, everything works fine.

3. xorg.conf.newest is the newest file generated by Nvidia 555 nvidia-settins. It forces the dummy plug to keep 25560 to 1440 resolution.
